                <strong>I have a BA in Music Composition, focusing on Jazz Composition. Most of my work was comprised of using Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) and notation software <br> 
                    to create and share my musical ideas. This photo was taken at my senior recital, where my originals were performed. I write for big band and small jazz settings, <br>
                    where I usually play piano. Otherwise, I am conducting the band. </strong>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong>I was born on January 24th, 2000 ("Born in 2000" jokes incoming) Born in South Korea, I moved to New Jersey at the age of 2. My dad is a battery engineer. 
                    He studied at Rutgers for his PhD. <br>
                    Afterwards, we bounced around from Skokie, Illinois, to Midland, Michigan, finally settling in Orange County, California. <br>
                    I have a sister who is 17, and she is the Drum Major at Northwood High School! I like playing chess, volleyball, and watching movies.
                </strong>
   
                    <h1>Quitting studying law for Coding</h1>
                    <strong> I was actually studying for the LSAT prior to considering coding. <br>
                        Although I was heavily invested in this, everything changed when I talked to a former Alumni of Berklee who also happened to live in Irvine. <br>
                         He had just recently quit a promising career as a litigation defense attorney in New York for a job in Front End Web Development! <br>
                         After talking to him, I became convinced that I should start coding!
